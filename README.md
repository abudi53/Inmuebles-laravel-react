# Inmuebles UJAP

## Introduction

This is a project for the University of José Antonio Páez, in the subject of Programming Languages, in which we developed a web application for the management of real estate. The application is developed in ReactJS for the frontend and PHP with Laravel for the backend. The database is managed by MySQL. It can create, read, update and delete (CRUD) real estate.  

## Features

- Show all real estate in a table, calculating the total price depending if it is for sale or rent.
- If it is for rent, it shows the expiration date of the contract.
- Edit, delete and create new real estate.
